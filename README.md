A multi-client TCP link for one server and multiple connections sharing one ROS publisher to send info.

Based on orignal Repo with the App from https://github.com/mirellameelo/ROS_2_ANDROID and forked into another repo to work with own setup.

Changed into Python with reference to https://blog.wittcode.com/blogs/python-socket-programming-multiple-clients-chat.
